name=Reservoir Capacity Change
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Lake & Reservoir Capacity Change Estimator is a QGIS plugin designed to estimate the initial and final capacity of lakes and reservoirs, enabling the assessment of capacity change over time. This tool is particularly useful for sedimentation analysis by quantifying storage loss. It generates elevation-capacity and area-elevation graphs and provides volumetric variations at different water levels. Additionally, the plugin includes an optional feature to crop the lake raster using a vector extent layer for more precise analysis.
